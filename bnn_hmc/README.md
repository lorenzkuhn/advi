## Subsampling experiments

This repo contains our code for our subsampling experiments described in section 4.2 of the report. 

Most of the code is based on https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/bnn_hmc, we just extend it with scripts to [launch multiple approximate inference runs](https://github.com/lorenzkuhn/advi/blob/main/bnn_hmc/launch_experiments.sh) and to [plot the results for these runs](https://github.com/lorenzkuhn/advi/blob/main/bnn_hmc/plot_results.py).
